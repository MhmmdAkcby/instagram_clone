# instagram_clone

In this project, I developed a social media app similar to Instagram using Flutter. The app integrates key Firebase services such as Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Firebase Storage. It allows users to upload photos, create posts, and view posts in a discover feed.

I utilized Provider for state management, efficiently handling user session management and data operations. The layout includes a dynamic grid structure created with Flutter Staggered Grid View, providing a modern display for user posts. For media handling, I implemented Image Picker and Firebase Storage for uploading profile pictures and posts.
